Shopify Orders App

A full-stack web application to manage Shopify orders efficiently. This project integrates a React.js frontend with a Node.js + Express backend, allowing users to view, track, and manage orders from a Shopify store in a clean and user-friendly interface.

The backend fetches order data directly from the Shopify Admin API, ensuring that the app always displays real-time order information. Users can see detailed order information, filter orders by status, and monitor sales effectively.
